# Left 4 Dead 2 Mod Checker

This checks if the mods in your l4d2 addons folder has any deleted workshop mods and also asks to move it to a subfolder called "gone". Made this cause I realized that L4D2 removed a couple of workshop mods when I booted it up. So this at least tells which one of them have been removed before I boot up the game.
